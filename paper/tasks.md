## Tracking outstanding tasks

Paper tasks:
- [ ] Do I even need the syntactic lemmas for type soundness? I don't really seem to
use them anymore.

- [ ] Check if r-sensitive sub works with polymorphism.

- [ ] Rust impl? Might be much easier than hacking stuff into the OCaml impl.

- [ ] Prove language instantiation we care about satisfies interface spec; final
error soundness for the instantiated langauge we care about.

- [ ] Soundness of polymorphic type inference; maybe relative completeness
proof?

- [ ] Prove that bounds are "no looser" in the paired setup.

Implementation tasks:
- [ ] Polymorphism, type inference (blocked on actual type inference algo)
