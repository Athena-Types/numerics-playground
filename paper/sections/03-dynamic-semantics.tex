\subsection{Substitution-style Operational Semantics}
The following is defined over untyped terms. In particular, we define the
operational semantics rewrite relation $\mapsto$ to map from (untyped) \Lang
to (untyped) \Lang. In other words, untypable programs can step (but not
necessarily to values).

\subsection{(Typed) Enviroment-style Operational Semantics}
The following is defined over typed terms. In particular, we define the
operational semantics rewrite relation $\rightsquigarrow$ to map from a typed
term in program multi-enviroments to a typed term in program multi-enviroments. Note
that in this setup, $\letbind x = v \ \tin \ f$, $[x]$, and $x$ are \textit{not}
values.

To be precise, $\rightsquigarrow$ maps an expression $e$ with type $\tau$
running in a enviroment (or multi-enviroment) $\sigma$ mapping variables like
$x_1$ to value $v_1$ with type $\tau'$ and sensitivity budget $s_1$ to a $e'$
with type $\tau'$ and enviroment $\sigma'$. So, $\sigma$ send variables like
$x_1 \to v_1 :_s \tau'$.

A (multi-)enviroment $\sigma$ is compatible with a typing context $\Gamma$ if
$\llbracket \sigma \rrbracket$ is a point within metric space $\llbracket \Gamma
\rrbracket$ (after erasing $\sigma$'s $0$-sensitive variables). Abusing notation
a little, I write this like so: $\llbracket \sigma \rrbracket \in \llbracket
\Gamma \rrbracket$.
% spell out definiion more

% \begin{equation*}
%   \llbracket \sigma \rrbracket \in \llbracket \Gamma \rrbracket 
%   \triangleq \forall
%   \\ 
%   (x \mapsto v :_s \tau) \in \sigma, 0 < s \implies (x :_s \tau) \in 
%   \Gamma
% \end{equation*}

% spell out definiion more
Similarly, $\llbracket \sigma \Vdash e : \tau \rrbracket$ is
interpreted as the point in the metric space $\llbracket \tau \rrbracket$
obtained by running e at $\sigma$.

Note that $\sigma$ is ordered in the case that variables are shadowed. $\sigma[x
\mapsto v :_s \tau]$ denotes lookup from the right (when on the left-hand side
of a rewrite relation) or insertion from the right (when on the right-hand side
of a rewrite relation).

Since we are affine, once we reduce to a value we do not care what happens to
leftover variables in the enviroment. Therefore, the following notation are
equivalent:
$$
\sigma_{idc} \Vdash v = \ \Vdash v = v
$$

To represent computations that may produce multiple values under a
multi-enviroment (e.g. the rounding effect), the following notation is
equivalent:
$$
\sigma; \sigma' \Vdash v = (\sigma \Vdash v); (\sigma' \Vdash v)
$$

% and
% $$
% \sigma \Vdash v_0;...;v_n = \sigma \Vdash v_0; ...; \sigma \Vdash v_n
% $$

% where $\sigma =  \gamma_0;...;\gamma_k$.

$\sigma + \sigma'$ represents pairwise concatenation over multi-enviroments,
defined as follows:

\begin{definition}[Enviroment sum]
  $\gamma_1 + \gamma_2$ = $\gamma_1 :: \gamma_2 $
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Enviroment tree sum]
  $. + .$ = $ . $ and $\gamma_0;\gamma_1 + \gamma_2;\gamma_3$ = $(\gamma_0 +
  \gamma_2);(\sigma_1 + \sigma_3)$ and $\_ + \_$ = $\bot$ otherwise.
\end{definition}
