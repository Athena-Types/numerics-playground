\section{Type Soundness}
Following Fuzz, we prove the following syntanctic properties relating our type
systema and operational semantics.

\begin{lemma}[Weakening]\label{thm:weakening}
  If $\Gamma \vdash e : \tau$, then $\Gamma + \Sigma \vdash e : \tau$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We induct over our typing devivation. 
  For each case, we can ignore arbitrary variables in our context (the type system is
  affine). 
  In particular, for the \textbf{!E}, \textbf{$\otimes$ E}, \textbf{+ E},
  \textbf{$M_u$~E}, and \textbf{$\otimes$ I} rules, the enviroment must be split
  into a $\Gamma$ (which can in some cases be scaled) and $\Delta$ (which does
  not ever get scaled); for each of these cases we choose to push unused
  variables into $\Delta$. 
\end{proof}

Following Fuzz, we prove a $r$-sensitive substitution lemma.
\begin{lemma}[$r$-sensitive subsitution]\label{thm:substitution}
  Let $\Gamma \vdash e : \tau$ and $\Theta, x :_r \tau \vdash e' : \tau'$, then 
  $r \cdot \Gamma + \Theta \vdash e'[e/x] : \tau'$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Follows by induction over the height of our typing derivation and applying the
  inductive hypothesis to each applicable premise.
\end{proof}

The following notation mirrors the look of the Fuzz metric perservation theorem
statement but contains differences in the construction. In particular, logical our
relation is neither coinductive nor step-indexed. It is also unary, using mutual
(well-founded) recursion between the definition of a syntactic term falling
within the logical relation and the definition of the syntactic distance between
terms.

For any two expressions $e_0, e_1$ falling in same type relation $e_0, e_1 \in
R_\tau$, we can write $e_0 \sim_r e_1$ where $r = \mathcal{SD}(e_0, e_1)$.
Similarly, we can write lists of expressions (e.g. for subsitutions) $\sigma_0,
\sigma_1$ for a given typing context $\Gamma$ such that: $\sigma_0 \sim_{\gamma}
\sigma_1 : \Gamma$ for a \textit{distance vector} $\gamma$
where
$\sigma_0 = e^0_0,~e^0_1,~\ldots e^0_n$ 
and $\sigma_1 = e^1_0,~e^1_1,~\ldots e^1_n$ 
and $\gamma = r_0, r_1, \ldots r_n$ such that:
$$e^0_0 \sim_{r_0} e^1_0 :
\tau_0,~e^0_0 \sim_{r_0} e^1_0 : \tau_0,~\ldots e^0_n \sim_{r_1} e^1_n :
\tau_n$$

\begin{theorem}[Metric preservation]
  For any $\Gamma \vdash e : \tau$ and substitutions $\sigma, \sigma'$ such that
  $\sigma \sim_{\gamma} \sigma' : \Gamma$, $e~\sigma \sim_{\gamma \cdot \Gamma}
  e~\sigma'$.
\end{theorem}
