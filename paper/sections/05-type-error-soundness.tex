\section{Type Soundness}

\begin{lemma}[Weakening]\label{thm:weakening}
  If $\Gamma \vdash e : \tau$, then $\Gamma + \Sigma \vdash e : \tau$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  We induct over our typing devivation. 
  For each case, we can ignore arbitrary variables in our context (the type system is
  affine). 
  In particular, for the \textbf{!E}, \textbf{$\otimes$ E}, \textbf{+ E},
  \textbf{$M_u$~E}, and \textbf{$\otimes$ I} rules, the enviroment must be split
  into a $\Gamma$ (which can in some cases be scaled) and $\Delta$ (which does
  not get scaled); for each of these cases we choose to push unused variables
  into $\Delta$. 
\end{proof}
